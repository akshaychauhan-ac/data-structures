		    Check swap, if yes continue else break (sort complete)
  
	2. Selection sort -
	      Find min
	      Swap min with first element
	      Continue from next element
	      Check for same number then swap
  
	3. Insertion sort -
	      Find small number. Push the number to index & Shift right the rest till the index where small number was found
	      Nearly sorted arrays

	      Sorting can occur as the data is received

	4. Merge Sort -
	      Split -> Compare and merge
	      O(n log n) O(n log n) O(n log n)
	      O(n) additional memory space

	5. Quick sort -
	      O(n log n) O(n log n) O(n2)
	      O(log n) additional memory space
